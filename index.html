    <h1 style="color:cyan; text-align: center;">Lachlan's IT Profile</h1>
    <h2 style="color:cyan; text-align: center;">Personal Information:</h2> 
    <p style="color:azure;">Hi! My name is Lachlan Morrow (s3942121@student.rmit.edu.au). I’m 24, and was born & raised in Victoria, Australia, though my family is of Irish heritage. My only spoken language is English, though I know a little bit of French. After graduating from high school in 2015, I went on to complete an Advanced Diploma of Professional Game Development & Graduate Diploma of Management from 2016-2018. Since then, I’ve worked as an independent game developer. My hobbies and interests include gaming, modern history, video editing, music & film.</p> 
    <p style="color:azure;">Fun fact, I’m also really into tabletop roleplaying games! I almost always have at least one ongoing game running as either a player or a GM, and enjoy a variety of games including D&D 5E, Pathfinder, World Of Darkness(WoD & CofD), Star Wars (Fantasy Flight) & Warhammer 40K (Only War, Dark Heresy).</p>
    <h2 style="color:cyan; text-align: center;">Interest In IT:</h2>
    <p style="color:azure;">I’ve just begun my Bachelor's degree of Information Technology at RMIT, as in 2021 I had reached a point where I was struggling to find reliable work in the small Australian game development industry, and wanted to branch out into the wider world of IT in general as a way of widening my skill set & improving my employability in a more broad range of more in-demand IT jobs.</p>
    <p style="color:azure;">I’ve been interested in IT for as long as I can remember. As a kid I was always interested in all kinds of different technology, and fascinated by computers & how they worked. After some discussions with family members that work in the IT Industry, and recommendations from them to branch out into the field as a way of acquiring more stable employment, I decided to apply for RMIT.</p>
    <p style="color:azure;">While I have a few specific areas of interest within IT (Software Development, Web Development, Cybersecurity & Artificial Intelligence) I’m far from decided on what I want to pursue long term as a career. My hope & expectation is that here at RMIT I’ll be able to explore each of these areas to some extent, in order to get the first hand experience necessary for me to decide what I do want to ultimately pursue. Once I’ve made that decision, I’m also hoping to be able to specialize in one of these fields to some extent later in my degree, in the form of electives & a minor.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color:cyan; text-align: center;">Ideal Job:</h2>
    <h3 style="color:cyan;"><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56308283?type=standout#sol=5e08b927d8baf18c9cd2cde70f4537e7084f9612">Job Advertisement</a></h3>
    <h3 style="color:cyan;">Position Description:</h3>
    <p style="color:azure;">This is a senior software engineer position at Thales, in the Melbourne CBD. With a focus on complex problem solving, system design & working with cutting edge aerospace technology, I think for those reasons it’s the kind of job I’d love to have. It’s also not stated, but it would be fair to assume that this kind of position would pay very well & have at least limited potential for remote work, which are also things I’m looking for.</p>
    <h3 style="color:cyan;">Skills/Qualifications/Experience Required:</h3>
    <p style="color:azure;">The position demands fluent & extensive knowledge of Java, Unix/Linux operating systems, creative problem solving skills, communication & teamwork skills, systems design skills & an Engineering, Computer Science or IT tertiary qualification.</p>
    <h3 style="color:cyan;">Skills/Qualifications/Experience Currently Held:</h3>
    <p style="color:azure;">I have extremely limited experience working with Java, but with foundational knowledge in other languages I feel confident in my ability to learn Java. While they are my preferred operating systems, I feel I lack extensive knowledge of Unix & especially Linux operating systems. I feel I already have solid creative problem solving & communication/teamwork skills. I have some experience in systems design, but not enough to be qualified for this kind of position. I also have not yet completed the required tertiary qualifications.</p>
    <p style="color:azure;">I feel confident that throughout the course of my studies at RMIT, I will be able to gain all the required skills I currently lack that would allow me to be qualified for a position like this. Even if Java is not taught at RMIT, I’m aware of multiple online courses that teach Java that I would be able to take in order to learn it.</p>

    <p style="color:azure;">Logician (INTP-T)</p>

    <h3 style="color:cyan;">Learning Style Test Results<sup><a href="#R2">[2]</a></sup>:</h3>
    <p style="color:azure;">Tactile/Kinesthetic</p>

    <h3 style="color:cyan;">Big Five Personality Test Results<sup><a href="#R3">[3]</a></sup>:</h3>


    <p style="color:azure;">While I’m not surprised by these results, I do think they are interesting and they largely line up with my own perception of myself. As is backed up by the results of the Myers-Briggs test, I tend to take an analytical approach to things, and I’m pretty introverted. I find my ideal work environment is alone with my own space, but with the ability to quickly and easily contact others as needed. I also find it easiest to learn new things by getting hands on and putting them into practice, which is backed up by the results of the learning style test I undertook. Within the context of a team environment, this may lead to getting absorbed in my own work and not being as collaborative or engaged with my team as I could be. I should try to remedy this by looking to form a team with at least a few more outgoing members, who are more likely to start collaborative conversations and keep be involved with the team as a whole. I should also make a conscious effort to engage with the team & ask for opinions & feedback, regardless of who they end up being.</p>

    
    <h2 style="color:cyan; text-align: center;">Project Idea:</h2>

    <h3 style="color:cyan;">Overview:</h3>
    <p style="color:azure;">My project idea is a free Android mobile app designed as a tool to help solve Wordle<sup><a href="#R4">[4]</a></sup> puzzles. It would be developed using Unity & C# as these are both tools & languages I am already proficient in using, thereby saving on time required to learn their use. The project is designed to be scalable, with a minimum viable product being easy to achieve within the set project time, but with room for additional features to be added as time permits. Once completed, the project is planned to be released onto the android app store, potentially with advertisement integration, time permitting.</p>

    <h3 style="color:cyan;">Motivation:</h3>
    <p style="color:azure;">Given the explosion in popularity that Wordle<sup><a href="#R4">[4]</a></sup> has experienced, there is a clear demand for tools to help solve difficult puzzles that users may be struggling with. These tools already exist for the most part, both on the web<sup><a href="#R5">[5]</a></sup> and on mobile<sup><a href="#R6">[6]</a></sup>. I also felt this project was a good match for my current programming skill level, as in its’ base version it involves fairly simple search/sort algorithm programming from a word list derived from an english dictionary, which I feel offers a good challenge, covering areas that I don’t have experience in, while still being simple enough to learn in the project timeframe.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color:cyan;">Description:</h3>
    <p style="color:azure;">The project is designed to be completed in stages, with the minimum viable product being based on the standard set by the competitor apps I’ve researched<sup><a href="#R5">[5]</a></sup><sup><a href="#R6">[6]</a></sup>. Because this minimum viable product should be fairly easy to achieve in the given time, I have planned the project to include further stages, each adding key features to build upon existing ones & improve upon the existing competitor apps, offering an increasing level of complexity & difficulty to the project. Below I outline the milestones & associated features planned for the project, intended to be completed in sequential order: </p>
    
    <p style="color:azure;"><strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong> - The app allows the user to input the state of the puzzle, consisting of attempted guesses, blacklisted letters, confirmed but out of position letters, and fully confirmed letters. Using this data, the app searches through an existing imported list of words derived from the one used by Wordle. I will be looking into finding the exact dictionary Wordle uses to generate its puzzles and if possible directly using this. If this isn’t possible, I will be using an open-source word list from an official English dictionary, of which I know there are many available online. With the word list and current puzzle state, the app will narrow down the dictionary word list to a list of possible correct answers. The exact sort/search algorithm to be used is yet to be determined, and this will be an area I will be directing research towards during the beginning stages of the project. The app will then display this list of possible solutions to the user.</p>

    <p style="color:azure;"><strong>Smart Guesses</strong>- The app uses statistical analysis to analyze the results from the foundational word search system, to determine which letters are more commonly used in the overall dataset and possible solution set, and use this to make intelligent suggestions for guesses, as opposed to simply listing all the possible solutions like in the minimum viable product stage.</p>
    
    <p style="color:azure;"><strong>Advertising Integration</strong>- The app incorporates mobile advertisements in order to generate some revenue from users. These ads would be presented at the beginning of a new use session, limiting them to a maximum of one per day, as that’s how often the global Wordle puzzles themselves refresh.</p>

    <p style="color:azure;"><strong>Stretch goal/Automation</strong>- The app works as a screen overlay on top of the puzzle as you solve it in another window, automatically reading & interpreting the state of the puzzle via an image recognition system. The app then feeds this data back into the existing foundational word search system, and generates suggested guesses in the background, which are then presented to the player either in the form of an overlaid UI element, or as a push notification. This means the user never has to shift back to the app itself once it has been started and manually input the current puzzle state.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color:cyan;">Tools & Technologies:</h3>
    <p style="color:azure;">This Wordle Solver app would be built using Unity & C# for reasons already outlined in the overview. My intent is to deploy the app for Android devices. Ideally I would like to be able to create both Android & iOS versions, but without an iOS device I would be unable to test it and therefore would not be able to do any of the important bug testing required on that platform. My testing platform will be a Samsung Galaxy S8. Version control will be handled through Github Desktop. I will also be using Visual Studio code as my IDE during development.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color:cyan;">Skills Required:</h3>
    <p style="color:azure;">This project will require knowledge of how to use the Unity game engine, mobile specific development practices & basic C# programming knowledge. I will need to learn how to import and work with an appropriate word list into Unity in order to implement the functionality required to be able to search through the possible word lists. I will also need a good understanding of how to program robust searching algorithms, as the program will be dealing with & sorting through large amounts of text data. I will also require a basic understanding of GitHub & version control software, in this case GitHub Desktop, in order to manage & back up project files, which I have.</p>

    <h3 style="color:cyan;">Outcome:</h3>
    <p style="color:azure;">If the project is successful, the outcome will largely be dependent on what stage of the project we have reached. If we only achieve the minimum viable product milestone, we will have made an app on par with most others on the market, but without anything to make it stand out, which will severely limit the impact it would have.</p>

    <p style="color:azure;">However with additional milestones reached, the project will be able to bring new features to the market & hopefully attract more attention & users. A best case scenario for this project would be the completion of all milestones, and a significant acquisition of regular users, generating a mild amount of income in the form of advertising revenue for the team.</p>
