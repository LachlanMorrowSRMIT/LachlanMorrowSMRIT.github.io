    <h1>My IT Profile:</h1>
    <h2>Personal Information:</h2> 
    <p>Hi! My name is Lachlan Morrow (s3942121@student.rmit.edu.au). I’m 24, and was born & raised in Victoria, Australia, though my family is of Irish heritage. My only spoken language is English, though I know a little bit of French. After graduating from high school in 2015, I went on to complete an Advanced Diploma of Professional Game Development & Graduate Diploma of Management from 2016-2018. Since then, I’ve worked as an independent game developer. My hobbies and interests include gaming, modern history, video editing, music & film.</p> 
    <h2>Interest In IT:</h2>
    <p>I’ve just begun my Bachelor's degree of Information Technology at RMIT, as in 2021 I had reached a point where I was struggling to find reliable work in the small Australian game development industry, and wanted to branch out into the wider world of IT in general as a way of widening my skill set & improving my employability in a more broad range of more in-demand IT jobs.</p>
    <p>I’ve been interested in IT for as long as I can remember. As a kid I was always interested in all kinds of different technology, and fascinated by computers & how they worked. After some discussions with family members that work in the IT Industry, and recommendations from them to branch out into the field as a way of acquiring more stable employment, I decided to apply for RMIT.</p>
    <p>While I have a few specific areas of interest within IT (Software Development, Web Development, Cybersecurity & Artificial Intelligence) I’m far from decided on what I want to pursue long term as a career. My hope & expectation is that here at RMIT I’ll be able to explore each of these areas to some extent, in order to get the first hand experience necessary for me to decide what I do want to ultimately pursue. Once I’ve made that decision, I’m also hoping to be able to specialize in one of these fields to some extent later in my degree, in the form of electives & a minor.</p>
